# n-body-sim-mpl
A basic n-body gravity simulation using matplotlib and numba acceleration, with the goal of observing large-scale gravitational interactions. I want this to be a piece of software that can be easily used to set and observe, then reset, tweak, and re-observe different circumstances, for research and for fun.
